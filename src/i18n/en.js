    attend1: "With high thermal efficiency and strong power performance, diesel engine can reduce 45% emissions of greenhouse gases. However, NOx and PM generated from combustion by diesel engine are the largest source of PM2.5. Diesel-powered trucks which account for only 7.8% of car parc, emit 57.3% NOx and 77.8% PM, being the top priority of prevention and treatment of pollution of motor vehicles. Hence, national ministries and commissions put pollution treatment of heavy-duty trucks high on the agenda of the tough battle of pollution prevention and treatment in 2018. ",
    attend2: "The emission limit plan of China 6a will be implemented in 2020 and of China 6b in 2023 in accordance with the latest policies. In such tough situation, whether commercial vehicles, non-road mobile machinery, engines manufacturers, or professional providers of emission technologies need to strengthen R&D update of energy conservation and emission reduction technologies, even make a layout of alternative energies and new energies products in advance as to prepare to meet tighter emission regulations. ",
